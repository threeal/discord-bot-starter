# Discord Bot Starter

A minimalist template for starting a new [Discord](https://discord.com/) bot project.

This template provides a basic Discord bot project containing a sample bot application that supports slash commands. The project is written in [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and utilizes the [Sapphire](https://sapphirejs.dev/) framework to help create the bot application. To simplify deployment, this template includes support for building a [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) image of the bot project.

## Key Features

- Minimal Discord bot project written in TypeScript with [ESM](https://nodejs.org/api/esm.html) support.
- Uses Sapphire as the framework for creating the Discord bot application.
- Supports building the Discord bot application as a Docker image.
- Uses [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) as the package manager with [Plug'n'Play](https://yarnpkg.com/features/pnp) support.
- Supports formatting with [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) and linting with [ESLint](https://eslint.org/).
- Preconfigured workflows for [Dependabot](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/dependabot) and [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions).
