# Discord Bot Starter

A minimalist template for starting a new [Discord](https://discord.com/) bot project.

This template provides a basic Discord bot project containing a sample bot application that supports slash commands. The project is written in [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and utilizes the [Sapphire](https://sapphirejs.dev/) framework to help create the bot application. To simplify deployment, this template includes support for building a [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) image of the bot project.
